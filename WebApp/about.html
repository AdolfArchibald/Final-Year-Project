                        Welcome to our little corner of the internet.
                        <br>
                        This site's all about giving you a heads-up on 20 stocks we think are going to shine each month.
                        <br>
                        We've built this platform to be totally free - no catch, no hidden fees - just a straightforward list of predictions to help you get ahead.
                        <br>
                        It's like a friend tipping you off about something good, only with stocks instead of coffee shops.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You can take these at face value or use them as additional reference when making your own stock choices.
                        <br>
                        You can export this to a PDF or Excel sheet for offline reference, or share the link with your friends.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        View the History or Performance pages to see what this model can potentially do for you!
                        <br>
                        PS - We all know this is still a risky game, we are not responsible for any losses.

                    <h2>Vision</h2>
                    <p>
                        Here's the heart of it: we're not just throwing stock tips at you and calling it a day.
                        <br>
                        We want to lift up your money game—help you understand what's going on with your cash and how to make it work harder for you.
                        <br>
                        Think of this as a stepping stone to feeling more confident about finances.
                        <br>
                        We're here to break it down, keep it real, and help you manage your money like a pro.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Using the Performance Graph, you can track exactly how your investment would have grown over the course of the last 15 months.
                        <br>
                        We also included a plotted line that tracks the S&P 500 index fund for comparison, just so you know how we are doing in context.

                <!-- Predictions Box -->

                    <p>
                        Picture this: we've got a machine learning setup that's like a super-smart buddy who's obsessed with numbers.
                        <br>
                        It digs into current stock prices, crunches a ton of data — like trends, volumes, and whatever else the market's whispering about
                        and spits out predictions for what's likely to pop off each month.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We've spent ages tweaking it, optimizing the heck out of it so it's not just guessing but actually learning from what's worked before.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It's not perfect (nothing is!), but it's pretty darn good at spotting the winners.
                    </p>

                        The History Graph is view only - it's there to show you how this model performed historically.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The Performance graph is more interactive - enter your amounts that you want to work with.
                        <br>
                        You can even use negative values for the monthly contributions, in the event you want to use some of your investment.
